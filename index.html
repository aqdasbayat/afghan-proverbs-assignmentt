    <h2>Welcome to Afghan Proverbs Site</h2>
    <section id="home">
        <p>Afghan proverbs are short, poetic sayings that reflect the rich cultural heritage, humor, and deep wisdom of the Afghan people. Passed down through generations, these proverbs capture everyday truths, life lessons, and social values using vivid imagery and clever phrasing. Whether spoken in Dari or Pashto, they often express the collective experiences of love, hardship, honor, and survival.In a country with a long oral tradition, proverbs serve as powerful tools for communication. Elders use them to advise the young, and friends use them to express agreement or gently correct one another. They are more than just words—they are reflections of Afghanistan’s history, resilience, and soul.</p>

            <p><b>Proverb Of The Day</b></p>
            <p>Da ilm maloomat sara, da akhlaq zarorat de.</p>
            <p>.د علم معلومات سره، د اخلاق ضرورت دی</p>
            <p>"Along with knowledge, good character is necessary."</p>
            <p>This proverb emphasizes that knowledge alone is not enough. Good character (akhlaq) is just as important for a person to be truly respected and valued. It suggests that without virtues like kindness, honesty, and empathy, a person cannot fully be considered wise or complete, no matter how much they know.</p>
